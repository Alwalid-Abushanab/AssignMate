# AssignMate

Our proposed project will be called Assignmate. The goal of AssignMate is to help students get their work done ahead of time by assisting with
organization, time management, and collaboration with their peers. With AssignMate, you'll be able to track assignment progress, set due dates and
reminders, store and share files, and work with your peers all on the same app.
